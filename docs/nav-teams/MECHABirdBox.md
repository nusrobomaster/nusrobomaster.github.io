# Team MECHABirdBox

## Introduction of Team members 

### Samantha Song (Leader)
I am a year 3 Biomedical Engineering student. I am in interested in robotics, AI and machine learning, and hope to  further my skills in these areas during my 6 months stay in Shenzhen. With knowledge that I learnt from my internship at a makerspace, I have experience in building robot cars, and can help in the fields of hardware/electronics and software.

### Tan Ning Xuan
I am a Year 4 Mechanical Engineering student, with an interest in controls and robotics. Over the years, I have built up my skills in programming and tinkering with various microcontrollers and embedded systems. During my student exchange at the University of California, Berkeley, I worked on a smart cycling helmet that featured real time image processing and multitasking. I have also worked on establishing communication between STM32 microcontroller and ROS as part of a autonomous golf buggy project. More recently, as part of the NUS Smart Shuttle autonomous vehicle trial, I developed a python script to pull data from APIs and perform simple data analysis to generate ridership insights. In terms of modelling software, I have had basic experience with CAD, Revit and ANSYS. I am confident these skills will be useful to the team in developing our robot.

### Kevyn Lim Zi Rong
I’m a year 4 BME student and i have had a keen interest in robots and robotic combat since childhood. I also really like thinking out of boxes and trying to make these ideas work in reality.


### Damien Chan 
I am a year 4 Industrial and Systems Engineering student. I do not have much experience with robotics but have some experience with programming and optimization. I hope to be able to use my skills to value add to build a strong robot.

## Key aspects of the robot to consider

### Mecanum wheels

* Lower part: spin stabilisation, Upper part: stationary
* Consists of wheel rollers and damping rings.
* Expandable wheels -> May reduce hits while in motion and technically not illegal until they patch this next year. There is a maximum of 10cm allowed for in-game expansion, so the max legal increase in radius of each wheel is 5cm.

### Chassis

* Front, Rear, Left, Right Armor. If possible, shock absorbers incorporated to reduce damage to robot parts.
* Impact detector: Transmit health of robot efficiently to controls system, direction of impact to the pilot UI.
* Intelligent sensing armour -> Infrared sensors near armour to detect when aiming beam lands on robot. Or gel pads to detect which part of the robot is being hit to move away accordingly
* Suspension system: to increase the stability of the robot especially during climbing, fly landing. Maneuvering robot should be as agile as possible.

### Gimbal

* Upper body of the robot will be mounted on the gimbal, such as the camera, blaster mechanism, high stability needed. If possible, 3-axis industrial grade gimbal will be used.

### Sensors

* IMU
* Lidar system: detect nearby robots (both ally and enemy) and location given in red/blue.
* Monitoring sensors: detect any malfunctioning parts.
* Ammo sensor: detect amount of ammunition available, when under a certain amount signal warning to pilot.
* Targeting system: Smart sensors to help robot target objectives, assist pilot in aiming. Estimated projectile trajectory motion to help compensate for long-distance shooting. 

### Ammo launching/loading system 

* Fire 17mm projectiles (maximum barrel speed: 45m/s)
* Ammo loading should not have jamming of projectiles
* Ammo should be fed to launching mechanism at a fast and steady rate.

### Media

* Camera (vision), GPU: should transmit a FPS view of the robot with clear resolution and minimal time lag from control system(pilot). Vision should be steady when robot moves across slopes/bumps, in-flight.
* Speaker (sound effects)

### Programming

* Targeting system, AI tracking systems
* STM32 main microcontroller
* Evasive Maneuvering Program (Spinning)

### Controls

* PID motion control
* Blaster targeting controls
* Intelligent Controlle

### General design and fabrication methods
* Most parts should be bought online and machined to desired specifications. Prototype, lightweight materials can be 3D printed with Kevyn’s 3D printer, using ABS/PLA material. Samantha can buy cheap electronics and mechanical parts in Shenzhen as well if possible, as well as use laser cutting, lathing equipment etc.
