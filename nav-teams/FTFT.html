Previously, I obtained my bachelor of science in statistics from NUS as well. After that, I worked in credit risk modelling in financial institute. I’m interested in the field of predictive modelling, feature engineering, big data engineering and Graph&amp; Web mining using R&amp; Python.</p> <h3 id="wang-yongtian"><a href="#wang-yongtian" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Wang Yongtian</h3> <p>I am a year 3 Mechanical engineering student. With the knowledge that I learnt from my major courses, I can help with the fields of mechanical design, assembling and testing. In addition, I am also interested in embedded programming, python, vision system. When I was in polytechnic, I have done projects about embedded programming with pretty good results. I have learnt python at summer school with a grade of A+. I also helped to make vision system to check failure products and surface cleanliness during the internship period. I have a good understanding and skilful at CAD, circuit troubleshooting and CNC machines. I hope my inter-disciplinary knowledge and skills could help our RM team.</p> <h3 id="ang-yik-hong"><a href="#ang-yik-hong" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Ang Yik Hong</h3> <p>I am a year 3 Mechanical Engineering student currently and in tend to pursue Robotics as the specialization. I have a strong interest in the field of robotics since I was young. I studied Diploma in Mechatronic and Robotics at Singapore Polytechnic after I finished my secondary school study in Malaysia. During the study in Singapore Polytechnic, I have done several robotic team projects, such as automated guided vehicle. Through the projects, I have learned a lot of skills, such as fabrication skills, problem solving skills and getting familiar with mechanical and electrical components. The reason why I would like to join the Robomaster is that I think it is a very good platform for me to strengthen my skills in Mechanical and Robotics.</p> <h3 id="liew-shaun-kheng"><a href="#liew-shaun-kheng" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Liew Shaun Kheng</h3> <p>I am a Year 3 undergraduate student from Mechanical Engineering. I am very Interested in Robotics and planning to specialize in this field in my upcoming year. During my academic years in Singapore Polytechnic, I pursued in Diploma in Mechanical Engineering, and I have done some projects that require good designing and fabrication skills. I have great dexterity in fabrication, CAD and Solidworks drawing, and have some fundamental knowledge in Python. I will work hard and commit to this project in order to enhance my technical and team-working skills through this project.</p> <h3 id="zou-yanfeng"><a href="#zou-yanfeng" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Zou Yanfeng</h3> <p>Interested in Robotics and planning to specialise in AI and communication systems.

I have basic knowledge on CAD and coding on several platforms. I am interested in robotics and the idea of building a working object from scratch. I feel that it is the best way to explore my interests and apply what I have learnt so far by putting it into practical uses. I feel that this journey will provide a different angle of learning, process and fulfilment that will be both memorable and valuable.</p> <h2 id="proposed-manpower-arrangement"><a href="#proposed-manpower-arrangement" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Proposed manpower arrangement</h2> <table><thead><tr><th>No</th> <th>Role</th> <th>Description</th> <th>Assigned to</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>1</td> <td>Mechanical</td> <td>Chassis; Suspension</td> <td>Yik Hong</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td> <td>Mechanical</td> <td>Gun; Gimbals system</td> <td>Liew Shaun Kheng</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td> <td>Electrical</td> <td>Power management; Electric Drive; Fail-safe</td> <td>Yongtian</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td> <td>Electronics</td> <td>Sensor interface; Close-loop Control</td> <td>Jody</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td> <td>Software</td> <td>Linux OS; Sensor drivers</td> <td>Li Chi</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td> <td>Software</td> <td>Computer vision; Motion planning</td> <td>Yanfeng</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td> <td>Operation</td> <td>Sponsorships; Chinese-English Translation</td> <td>Open Position</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td> <td>Operation</td> <td>Accounting; Publicity Materials</td> <td>Open Position</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td> <td>Pilot</td> <td>TX &amp; RX system; Game-play strategy</td> <td>Open Position</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>For interested people to join our team, please contact Telegram @burgerkheng</p> <h2 id="proposed-timeline-and-milestones"><a href="#proposed-timeline-and-milestones" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Proposed timeline and milestones</h2> <table><thead><tr><th>Subject</th> <th>Estimated Date</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Registration and Role Allocation</td> <td>15 September 2019</td></tr> <tr><td>Send request to purchase self study materials</td> <td>20 September 2019</td></tr> <tr><td>Run down of Rule book</td> <td>25 October 2019</td></tr> <tr><td>Mock-examination 1 of competition rule book</td> <td>5 November 2019</td></tr> <tr><td>Drafting of needed components for purchase, Start of technical proposal</td> <td>10 November 2019</td></tr> <tr><td>Mock-examination 2 of competition rule book</td> <td>15 November 2019</td></tr> <tr><td>Rule-book assessment</td> <td>20 September 2019</td></tr> <tr><td>Send draft of technical proposal,  list of purchase item for approval</td> <td>25 November 2019</td></tr> <tr><td>Start Assembly and fabrication of required components and softwares</td> <td>6 December 2019</td></tr> <tr><td>Checkpoint for basic components of robot, e.g. power, communication, movement, etc</td> <td>26 December 2019</td></tr> <tr><td>Mid term assessment</td> <td>23 January 2019</td></tr> <tr><td>Checkpoint for more advanced components of robot, e.g. Sensors, computer visions, software</td> <td>15 February 2019</td></tr> <tr><td>Final Assessment</td> <td>1 March 2020</td></tr> <tr><td>Referee System Installation</td> <td>1 March 2020</td></tr> <tr><td>Progress check for basic components of robot, e.g. power, communication, movement, etc</td> <td>1 April 2020</td></tr> <tr><td>Progress check for more advanced components of robot, e.g. Sensors, computer visions, software</td> <td>1 May 2020</td></tr> <tr><td>Testing of robot 1</td> <td>15 May 2020</td></tr> <tr><td>Testing of robot 2</td> <td>30 May 2020</td></tr> <tr><td>Testing of robot 3</td> <td>15 June 2020</td></tr> <tr><td>Testing of robot 4</td> <td>30 June 2020</td></tr></tbody></table> <h2 id="key-aspects-of-the-robot-to-consider"><a href="#key-aspects-of-the-robot-to-consider" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Key aspects of the robot to consider</h2> <h3 id="mecanum-wheels"><a href="#mecanum-wheels" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Mecanum wheels</h3> <ul><li>Robots can move parallel in all directions without turning their visual fields around in the game, so as to achieve a variety of ‘zigzag’ movement and precise strikes in the battle.</li> <li>It is mainly composed of wheel hub and rollers.
