## Culture

Robomaster is the first international competition involving shooting confrontation between robots. Merging the elements of robotics technologies with e-sports, it not only sets up an exciting competitive combating platform but also creates a stage for robotics competition of a higher level. It is drawing attention of hundreds of institutions and robotics enthusiasts from all over the world.

Our team will focus on the research of robotics structural design, movement control and system integration and keep track of latest researches on key technologies in robotics. More attention will be given to specialized robots, industrial robots and unmanned driving technologies. By encouraging team members to participate in various contests in robotics, we will hone their abilities in self-inquiry and innovation potentials.

## Standard Robot Proposal

### Role

The Main Battle Robot in the field, performs tactical attack, defense, cooperation and maneuvers, triggering the Double Damage Power Rune, as well as long range shooting.

### Design Requirements

<img class="himg" src="./assets/team-beeblebum/standard/design-requirements.png">

### Key Features

- Problem 1: Robots Cannot Move While Spinning
  - Solution:
    - Remove the spinning structure from the chassis by adding an additional spinning layer.
    - Use a gear system and a counter balance load to stabilize the overall torque.
    - The gear system is like that of a planetary gearbox, with planets connected to fixed motors and other parts of equal mass rotate accordingly. <img class="himg" src="./assets/team-beeblebum/standard/gears.png">
- Problem 2: The Operator Cannot Pinpoint His Robot's Location Relative to Other Robots
  - Solution:
    - Present a real-time mini map to assist operators.
    - Make use of LIDAR to detect the location of the nearby robots.
    - Use LIDAR to detect nearby robots and send the information as a real-time mini map to the operator together with the first-person view captured by the camera.
- Problem 3: The Ballistic Trajectory of the Bullet is Inaccurate
  - Solution:
    - Use two sets of friction wheels at the same plane to accelerate the bullet at the same time.
    - Separately control the x- and y-directions of the bullet.
    - Prevent the bullet from touching the barrel.

### Other Considerations

- Parts and design:
  - With a tight schedule, we should make full use of off-the-shelf components and make our design fit these available parts from the very beginning.
- Fabrication accuracy and tolerance for errors:
  - Due to different fabrication methods, there are minor differences from our design and the actual parts. It is also necessary to take this into account in the designing process.
- Chassis rigidity and the displacement wheels position:
  - Many teams reported problems on the displacement of the wheels in the direction of the spindle. We attribute this pitfall to the lack of rigidity in the chassis design, especially around the mounting place of the wheels. We may overcome it by refine the design and make full use of open-source materials. 
- Anti-clash protection of the wheels:
  - Clashing is unavoidable in real-life competitions, as we discovered through analyzing the videos. By moving the wheels inwards and protect them by the outer frame of the chassis, it prevents the possible damage to the wheels owing to clashes. <img class="himg" src="./assets/team-beeblebum/standard/1.jpg">
- Light and efficient suspension system:
  - While some complicated suspension systems provide outstanding stability, we strive to develop a light and efficient system that consists of less movable components and provides better stability.
- Reliable feeding and accurate firing system:
  - We can use the Archimedean spiral and motor to address the problem of failure to feed. Meanwhile, we can use the optimization of the angle range for the best shooting accuracy. Besides, by giving the ball an angular speed in the moving direction through mounting the flywheels with a specific deviation from the pointing direction of the barrel, we may have a better shot.

## Sentry Robot Proposal

### Role

The main defense robot in the field, forms the first and the most important line of defense for the base. It features autonomous rontrol and automatic shooting. If sentry is taken out, the base will lose its shield, making it much more vulnerable.

### Design Requirements

<img class="himg" src="./assets/team-beeblebum/sentry/design-requirements.png">

### Key Features

- Problem 1: No Manual Control
  - Solution:
    - Implement advanced recognition and aiming system
    - While enemy is detected, shoot it at the furthest range possible
    - Use stereo vision with optical flow to get depth data for better aiming at far range
- Problem 2: The Movement of the Sentry is Predictable
  - Solution:
    - Move with varying speed and randomized direction
    - Let sentry randomly reverse direction or navigate to a new direction on the track
    - While moving along the track, use an ease-in and ease-out motion by providing non-constant power from the motors. After each reverse in direction, generate a random number corresponding to a random location on the track. Assign weightage to such randomized location and use it as a parameter to determine the next reverse location or the next counter-attack location based the detected enemy location. If the sentry is hit while stopped at a certain location, immediately escape to a random location while spinning the armor layer. If the enemy is being attacked by the sentry at the same time, shoot the enemy while navigating to the new location
