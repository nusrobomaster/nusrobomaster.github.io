Otherwise, the fellow engineer will pull it back to restoration zone to recover, which takes the longer time. Hence, the standard robot should move fast enough to go back to restoration zone when they are seriously injured.</p></li> <li><p>During the competition, the standard robot should aim to attack the opponent’s hero and the standard robot near it since the accuracy may decrease when attacking from a distance. Furthermore, the standard robot is not supposed to attack the engineer since the engineer has high HP and it is hard and time-consuming to kill it. Engineers are generally heavier and larger than the standard robot, they may block the way. Thus, the speed and agility of the standard robot are highly important so that it can keep away from the engineer to escape or attack other targets.</p></li> <li><p>During the competition, it should also assist the hero robot in attacking the opponent’s sentry, in order to open the base shield.</p></li> <li><p>After a few minutes, the runes will be available and infantry should try to get the rune since the hero’s shooting speed may be slower (Hero may have 42mm bullet). Hence, The gimbal of the standard robot should have wide attacking range to allow the gun to shoot the rune.</p></li> <li><p>Besides attacking, the standard robot is supposed to occupy the bridge top region or the bunker in order to get the bonus. To decrease the damage, we will implement a mode to make the chassis keep spinning when it is occupying the regions.</p></li> <li><p>Finally, when the opponent’s sentry is dead, the infantry should move close to the base and shoot.</p></li></ol> <p>    Conclusiton: Since the infantry is best suited to attacking enemy robots in a short distance and it needs to go back to gain health and refill, we should focus on its agility in order to attack or defend effectively. Accuracy is the second focus since the infantry aims to hit the rune and attack the enemies.</p> <h2 id="overall-mechanical-design"><a href="#overall-mechanical-design" class="header-anchor">#</a> Overall Mechanical Design</h2> <p><img src="/assets/img/NUSNextBot-Rough_Design.60588318.jpeg" alt="Mech-Rough-Design"> <em>Figure1.

Chassis</em></p> <h3 id="wheels-mechanical"><a href="#wheels-mechanical" class="header-anchor">#</a> Wheels (Mechanical):</h3> <p>    We would like to use Mecanum wheels in the robot to make it agile. The reason is that if we use traditional wheels, the changing of direction of movement will take one more additional step than using Mecanum wheels, turning, which takes much time and space. However, using Mecanum wheels, by controlling the direction of rotation of the wheels, the robot can move in different directions instantaneously without turning. Moreover, it does not need a rotating shaft to yaw rotate the direction of the wheels, so that it simplifies the mechanical designs and reduces the weight of the vehicle, enabling it to run faster and become more agile. The movement of individual wheels will be programmed so that the pilot can easily control the movement of the robot using WASD keys.</p> <p>    Unlike traditional wheels that only create friction force point forward and backward, Mecanum wheels create a diagonal force so that different combinations of rotation directions on different wheels can create four movement patterns. These are forward/backward, leftward/rightward (Figure 3), diagonal movements (Figure 4) and on-spot yaw rotations.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/NUSNextBot-Wheels1.ecc294d0.png" alt="Mech-Wheels1"> <a href="https://blog.csdn.net/zhaoyuaiweide/article/details/75560257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Figure3.

We will implement the robot controls such that the camera and gun barrel move independently from the spinning of the chassis.</p> <p>    We intend to ensure that the gun barrel will stay still relative to the surroundings, while the chassis is spinning clockwise. At algorithmic level, while the chassis is spinning, the gimbal will rotate in the opposite direction by the same degree, to offset the wheel’s rotation. As such, the gun barrel will always point to the same direction without pilot intervention. This ensures precision when aiming at the same target, allowing the chassis to simultaneously spin in order to avoid incoming bullets hitting the armor modules.</p> <p>    From the pilot’s perspective, the spin of the chassis will be controlled by the keyboard. The mouse is used to control the aiming of the gun barrel. Without moving the mouse, the algorithm mentioned above will ensure that gun barrel is relatively still.</p> <h2 id="launching-system"><a href="#launching-system" class="header-anchor">#</a> Launching system:</h2> <p>    The launching system is important for the robot to attack opponents in the competition. There are four main methods of launching, namely gunpowder launching, pneumatic launching, spring launching and friction wheel launching. Among these four methods, friction wheel launching has the advantages of security, simple design, low cost and stable launching.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/NUSNextBot-Lauching_System.eff4e3c7.jpg" alt="Mech-Launching-System"> <em>Figure 7. Overview of the launching mechanism</em></p> <h3 id="design-of-the-structure-mechanical"><a href="#design-of-the-structure-mechanical" class="header-anchor">#</a> Design of the structure (Mechanical)</h3> <p>    The system shown in Figure 6 is the friction wheel launching system, which consists of the hopper, dial, supply link and friction wheel. Projectiles entering the hopper will fall on to the dial with the lead of brushes or 3D-printed parts. The dial will push projectiles into the hole of the supply link.</p> <p>    After a projectiles drop into the hole, they will slip onto the friction wheel through the supply link. Two friction wheels are driven by two reverse-rotating motors, so these 2 wheels will rotate in opposite direction (one rotates clockwise, and the other anticlockwise) but with the same frequency. The distance between 2 friction wheels is slightly smaller than the diameter of projectiles, so when projectiles get contact with 2 friction wheels, they will be squeezed and continue moving forward in the barrel of the gun. In this process, projectiles will experience frictional force and compression due to the high-speed rotation of friction wheels. When projectiles are released, they will have kinetic energy from being accelerated by the friction wheels.</p> <ul><li><p>Dial:</p> <p>Poor dial design is the primary cause of the projectiles getting stuck. Thus there are many important factors to consider for dial design. Firstly, the dial cannot be too high, as this may cause the projectiles to be squeezed under the dial when turning. Secondly, the turning angle of the dial motor should be constant. If not, the projectile will not be sent into the hole of supply link, and end up stuck at the hole. Thirdly, when the dial is rotating, we may have many bullets cluster together and get stuck. Using guides like brushes and 3D-printed parts can prevent the problem of accumulation of projectiles. In above figure, the system uses brushes to guide projectiles to fall on the dial.</p></li> <li><p>Supply link:</p> <p>The curved portion between the supply link hole and the friction wheel should be well-designed to make sure projectiles can smoothly roll down to the friction wheels. Otherwise, when the gun reaches its maximum elevation(+23.5 degrees), projectiles falling from the hole may stop at the curving part and may not continue to fall to reach the friction wheel. Therefore, the radius of the curving part should be large enough to prevent this kind of situation.</p></li> <li><p>Friction wheel:</p> <p>Friction wheel consists of two parts, the outer layer and the motor. The outer layer will be in contact with the projectiles, and is generally made of a material with soft texture and large surface friction, such as silica gel. A pair of friction wheels rotate in different directions. After one projectile leaves the friction wheel, another projectile will contact the friction wheels consecutively.</p></li></ul> <h3 id="motor-of-friction-wheels-electrical"><a href="#motor-of-friction-wheels-electrical" class="header-anchor">#</a> Motor of friction wheels (Electrical)</h3> <p>    Snail 2305 motor and 430R electrical speed controller are used together to power the frictional wheels. This motor and corresponding controller can deliver high torque and power instantaneously to the wheel so that the projectile can be released with a relatively high speed (just under 30m/s, within the competition requirements).</p> <h2 id="general-design"><a href="#general-design" class="header-anchor">#</a> General Design</h2> <h3 id="pid-controllers-software"><a href="#pid-controllers-software" class="header-anchor">#</a> PID Controllers (Software)</h3> <p>    In order to improve the robot’s agility, we should have a fine degree of control over the motors, which will allow it to move at the exact speed or angle that we want. For instance, the shooting speed of the gun should be limited under a specific value, and the robot should move and stop precisely as controlled.</p> <p>    A proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller is a control loop mechanism with feedback loop to provide a parameter to adjust the current value. It is employed here in order to control the actuators.</p> <p>    Thus, PID controllers will be implemented in projectile, chassis, gimbal control modules to control the motors on friction wheels, Mecanum wheels and gimbal respectively. PID controllers will work together with Inertial measurement unit (IMU) and wheel encoders to improve the agility (Figure 8).</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/NUSNextBot-PID.12632b69.png" alt="PID-Flowchart"> <em>Figure 8. Rough Structure of PID controllers</em></p> <h3 id="auto-aiming-software"><a href="#auto-aiming-software" class="header-anchor">#</a> Auto-aiming (Software)</h3> <p>    During the competition, it might be hard to aim at enemies’ armours accurately, thus, we require computer vision to assist the pilot once they have roughly aimed at the target. Moreover, in order to get the rune, the robot has to shoot 5 armors continually within 2.5 seconds, which is difficult for the pilot to aim and shoot. Hence, auto-aiming should be used to shoot the runes instead of manual control.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/NUSNextBot-Auto_Aiming.f60d0f30.png" alt="Auto-Aiming"> <em>Figure 9. auto-aiming workflow</em></p> <p>    We will use Kalman filters to predict the armor areas, since it only needs estimated state from the previous time step and the current measurement without history of observations or estimates to compute. To simplify, we decide to assume the robot has a constant speed in a short period of time. The use of Kalman filter is shown in Figure 10. In Figure 10, x represents state, P represents error covariance, F is the prediction function, Bk is the control matrix, uk is the control vector depends on known external influences, Qk is additional uncertainty from environment, K is the Kalman gain, Hk is a set of sensor readings, Rk is the covariance of the sensors’ uncertainty, and zk is the mean according to the reading we observed. We will use position and velocity of the target as state components, and then predict its current state.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/NUSNextBot-Kalman_Filter.1314b938.jpg" alt="Kalman-Filter"> <a href="https://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Figure 10.
