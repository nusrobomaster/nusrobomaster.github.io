Although it is noticeably less powerful than the Hero Robot (in terms of damage output), the sheer number of standard robots allowed on the field makes it an incredibly key factor in swinging gameplay through strategic divisive work. Hence, one of the main consideration in the design of this robot is in its accuracy. This is achieved by stabilizing the barrel and isolating its movement from the main chassis, as well as several toggle-able mechanisms for auto-targeting. A secondary concern is in its survivability (both physical robustness and in-game).
