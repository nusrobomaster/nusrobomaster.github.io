# Team RoboCop

## Introduction

Nguyen Tuan Dung

I am currently a year 1 Mechanical Engineering student who is also second majored in iDP. I have had 4 years of experience with robotics in secondary and high school. One of the competitions I participated in was VEX Robotics Competition. Within the four years, I have won 4 tournament champions and 3 excellent award for high school category in Singapore VEX Robotics Competition. I also moved on to represent Singapore in the World VEX Robotics Championship twice and the highest award I achieved was Division Finalist. For robotics, my interest focuses on mechanical design and building of the robot. I can also become the pilot or provide coaching for pilot during match.
