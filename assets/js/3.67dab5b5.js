Therefore, a well designed suspension system is required.\nThere are 2 types of suspensions: Active and passive suspension. In contrast to active suspensions, passive suspensions do not rely on powered rotational or linear actuators to dissipate energy. Instead they rely on conventional coiled springs and dampers to reduce the magnitude of disturbances on the robot.
